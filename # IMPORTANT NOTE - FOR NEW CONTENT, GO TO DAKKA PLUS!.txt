This version of the Dakka Improvement Project (now known as the Legacy version) is the same remodel pack as it was, featuring most of the original cast of 120+ vehicles. This version might occasionally receive new content; however, this will likely not happen often.

13 existing models have been moved to a new home, in addition to some new + overhauled vehicles. These can all be found in a new home -- the "DAKKA PLUS" pack.

Dakka Plus is a remodel pack including a number of vehicles with additional equipment (beyond just singular MGs), available for download separately. This will be taking the place of the old "Dakka Improvement Project" for the bulk of new content updates, and will take more of a "quality-over-quantity" approach.
