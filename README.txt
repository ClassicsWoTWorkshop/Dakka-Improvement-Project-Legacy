Thank you for downloading!

This mod adds more dakka (mainly machine guns) to a selection of vehicles which were previously lacking a little in that department (hence its' title, "Dakka Improvement Project"). Thus far, the following vehicles are included:

VERSION 1 (19. June 2018, 23 vehicles)

- France: AMX 13 57, AMX 13 57 GF, B-C 12 t
- Italy: P.43 Bis, P.43 Ter, P.44 Pantera
- Japan: O-I Exp., O-I, Chi-Ri
- USA: M4 Improved, T14, M6A1, T20, T69, T32, Chrysler K GF
- USSR: MT-25, LTG, SU-100M1, T-54 Ltwt., Object 257, ST-I

PLEASE NOTE: More vehicles are on the way soon.


TO INSTALL:
- Drop the "CWW-Dakka-Improvement-Project" folder into <Your WoT Directory>\res_mods\<game version number>. (Example: C:\Games\World_Of_Tanks\mods\1.0.2.1)

- QUICK NOTE: For your convenience, all of the vehicles included in the mod are packaged in separate wotmods. In case there happen to be any vehicles included in the mod which you don't want any extra dakka for, then all you have to do is remove their individual wotmod(s) from the aforementioned "CWW-Dakka-Improvement-Project" folder (inside <WoT Install Location>\mods\). The vehicle's names are written in the name of the wotmod files, and are sorted into subfolders by nation (again, for your convenience).

Enjoy!
